Views 

Views live in the directory app/views/controller_name/action_name.html.erb, where controller_name is the name of the controller the view is linked to and action_name.html.erb is the corresponding method inside the controller that was run immediately prior to rendering the view.


Rendering in Sinatra

To render a html page in one of your routes you can use the 'erb' (embedded ruby) function. This is how you use the erb files that you create in your views folder.

Layouts in Sinatra

Sinatra can use layouts as a basic structure of a site or page. A different layout can be specific but the default is layout.erb.

Sessions

“Sessions” are the idea that your user’s state is somehow preserved when he/she clicks from one page to the next. Remember, HTTP is stateless, so it’s up to either the browser or your application to “remember” what needs to be remembered.\n\n In practice, this is done by creating things like cookies, which can be implemented in Sinatra similarly to Rails.

DSL

A domain-specific language (DSL) is somewhere between a tiny programming language and a scripting language, and is often used in a way analogous to a programming library. The boundaries between these concepts are quite blurry, much like the boundary between scripting languages and general-purpose languages.
