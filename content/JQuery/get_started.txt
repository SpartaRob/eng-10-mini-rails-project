Getting Started with jQuery

Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages:
To start, copy the below script tag into the bottom of the body section of your html file.

<body>
  // Body Content
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</body>

Next, in your js file, you need to add a Document Ready Event. All of your jQuery methods must be inside this as follows:

$(document).ready(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});

Basic Syntax:
The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action() which is comprised of:

A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
